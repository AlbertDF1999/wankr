## 🎨 What You’re Creating

The Shame Soldiers aren’t just a single army. They’ve mutated into **7 core roles**, each with **4 unique sub-roles** — for a total of **28 archetypes**:

- **Infantry** — Shield, Spear, Pike, Medic  
- **Cavalry** — Lancer, Rider, Archer, Charger  
- **Artillery** — Cannoneer, Mortar, Rocketeer, Sapper  
- **Scouts** — Tracker, Sniper, Saboteur, Messenger  
- **Commanders** — Tactician, Strategist, Morale Officer, Signal Caller  
- **Siege** — Engineer, Catapult, Ram, Bombard  
- **Warlords** — Overlord, Shaman, Champion, Tyrant  

Each sub-role comes in 4 rarities:

- 🟢 **Common** — backbone of every army (funny doodle style encouraged)  
- 🔵 **Rare** — more consistent and specialized  
- 🟣 **Epic** — boosted abilities, more detailed, often line art or silhouette style  
- 🟡 **Legendary** — AAA game-quality, hooded, detailed, cinematic

## ⚔️ Alignment Templates

We’ve provided some **golden ratio templates** inside this repo.  
These are **not meant to be part of your artwork**, but to help with **placement and balance**.  
Think of them like stencils: use them to keep your designs centered and visually consistent.

## 📝 Example Prompts

If you’re using ChatGPT or another AI tool, here are example prompts:

- **Rare Spear (Template #2, Blue theme):**  
  > "Create a digital illustration of a stylized spear centered inside a square 1024×1024 canvas. Use golden ratio circle placement from the provided guide. Background navy blue (#04588C) with aqua (#79F2E6) accents. Rare NFT style — clean, simple, but polished."

- **Common Spear (Template #1, Doodle style):**  
  > "Draw a hand-drawn doodle of a stick figure holding a broomstick spear with a banana duct-taped at the end. Style should look funny and low-effort, like a quick sketch. PNG format, centered inside a square 820×820 canvas."

## 🚨 Automatic Checks

When you submit, our system will **automatically validate**:
- Images are square  
- Images are at least 820×820  
- Folder structure follows the rules  

If something doesn’t pass, we’ll ask you to fix it.
