# 🚀 WANKR Token

> **The Unholy Birth of WankerGiat** - Base chain's least expected antihero

## 🌟 The Legend

They found him in a ditch.

Wrapped in a tattered onesie — front-stitched with "Wanker", back-branded with "Giat" — the Base chain's least expected antihero was born. Orphaned by the memepocalypse, raised by algorithms and mid takes, he was scooped up by none other than BankerBot, who took pity on the strange, greasy infant and declared him kin. Thus, WankerGiat became the stepbrother nobody asked for — and yet the chain somehow needed.

Where BankerBot optimized trades, WankerGiat optimized shame.

He grew not in wisdom, but in weaponry.

## ⚡ The Token with a Temper

The $WANKR token is not your friend. It is not for tipping. It is not for liking. It is not for rewarding effort.

**It is the anti-tip. The down-only dopamine slap.**
A tokenized form of disapproval.
A vote of no confidence, delivered with gas and giggles.

## 🎯 Utility? It's Got Plenty

- 🧢 **Engagement Farming Deterrent** – Someone posts a thread starting with "Unpopular opinion:" followed by a very popular opinion? Send them 1 WANKR.
- 🪞 **Troll Repellent** – Someone replies "cope" to your chart? WANKR them on sight.
- 🪙 **Inverse Clout Score** – The more $WANKR you hold, the more people think you're full of it.
- 🎭 **Public Shaming Protocol** – Top WANKR holders are tracked and displayed. Onchain leaderboard of midness.
- 🧮 **Spectral Judgment Scale** – From 1 (Mildly Mid) to 10 (Full Blown Wanker).
- 🚫 **The Forbidden Send** – 69 WANKR must never be sent. Ever. Doing so may rupture the memetic balance of the Base chain. Only one is capable. We don't say their name.

## 🏛️ Governance? Lmao.

There is no DAO. Only shame. Only WANKR.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Blockchain**: Base chain (where legends are born)
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity-based with built-in shame mechanics
- **Frontend**: Modern web3 interface for maximum WANKR distribution
- **Backend**: Decentralized infrastructure powered by pure spite

## 📋 Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundation 🏗️
- [x] Repository setup and documentation
- [ ] Smart contract development with shame mechanics
- [ ] Security audits (because even WANKR needs to be secure)
- [ ] Testnet deployment on Base

### Phase 2: Launch 🚀
- [ ] Mainnet deployment
- [ ] Token distribution (to the worthy... or unworthy)
- [ ] Exchange listings (where WANKR can spread its message)

### Phase 3: Ecosystem 🌱
- [ ] WANKR leaderboard implementation
- [ ] Shame protocol integrations
- [ ] Community expansion (the more, the merrier... or shamer)

## 📊 Tokenomics

- **Total Supply**: TBA (but definitely not 69)
- **Initial Price**: TBA (probably too high for what you deserve)
- **Vesting Schedule**: TBA (instant gratification for instant shame)
- **Allocation**: TBA (mostly to people who need it most)
