# 🚀 WANKR Token

> **The Unholy Birth of WANKR GYATT** - Base chain's least expected antihero

## 🌟 The Legend

They found him in a ditch.

Wrapped in a tattered onesie — front-stitched with "WANKR", back-branded with "GYATT" — the Base chain's least expected antihero was born. Orphaned by the memepocalypse, raised by algorithms and mid takes, he was scooped up by none other than BankerBot, who took pity on the strange, greasy infant and declared him kin. Thus, WANKR GYATT became the stepbrother nobody asked for — and yet the chain somehow needed.

Where BankerBot optimized trades, WANKR GYATT optimized shame.

He grew not in wisdom, but in weaponry.

## ⚡ What WANKR Is

WANKR is a **POS protocol**. And if you just snickered "piece of sh*t," cut it out and pay attention.

**Here, POS = Proof of Shame** — tracked on the [WANKR Watch Dune dashboard](https://dune.com/mrpapawheelie/wankr-watch) (running, cumulative leaderboard).

## 🎯 How It Works

- **Top 50 Shame Soldiers** = ranked by delivered PoS (sending 10 $WANKR)
- **It's cumulative**: early + active = easier to stay on top; late = grind to climb (as it should be)
- **Why care**: Top 50 get priority rewards: free NFT mints, collab perks, and partner airdrops (projects can scrape the Top 50 and airdrop via @bankrbot216)

## 🏆 The Token with a Temper

The $WANKR token is not your friend. It is not for tipping. It is not for liking. It is not for rewarding effort.

**It is the anti-tip. The down-only dopamine slap.**
A tokenized form of disapproval.
A vote of no confidence, delivered with gas and giggles.

## 🎭 Utility? It's Got Plenty

- 🧢 **Engagement Farming Deterrent** – Someone posts a thread starting with "Unpopular opinion:" followed by a very popular opinion? Send them 10 $WANKR.
- 🪞 **Troll Repellent** – Someone replies "cope" to your chart? WANKR them on sight with 10 $WANKR.
- 🪙 **Inverse Clout Score** – The more $WANKR you hold, the more people think you're full of it.
- 🎭 **Public Shaming Protocol** – Top 50 Shame Soldiers tracked and displayed. Onchain leaderboard of midness.
- 🧮 **Spectral Judgment Scale** – From 1 (Mildly Mid) to 10 (Full Blown Wanker).
- 🚫 **The Forbidden Send** – 69 WANKR must never be sent. Ever. Doing so may rupture the memetic balance of the Base chain. Only one is capable. We don't say their name.

## 📜 House Rules for Throwing Your 10 $WANKR

- **Be funny, not foul**. Think water-balloon fight, not malice.
- **No spam**. X will throttle you if you paste the same line to randos.
- **Add a reason**. Personalized roasts travel further than generic shade.
- **People may get salty**. Whatever. Don't be boring.

## 🏛️ Governance? Lmao.

There is no DAO. Only shame. Only WANKR.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Blockchain**: Base chain (where legends are born)
